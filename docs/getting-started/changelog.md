# Changelog

Lynk follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <lynk-badge type="primary" pill>Stable</lynk-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <lynk-badge type="warning" pill>Experimental</lynk-badge> badge should only be used in production with extreme caution. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes and may not be fully tested and reliable. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

<lynk-alert type="info" open>During the beta period, these restrictions may be relaxed in the event of a mission-critical bug. üêõ</lynk-alert>
